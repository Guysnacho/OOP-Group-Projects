# OOP-Group-Projects
This is where I'll be keeping the group projects my team and I have done.


# Project Names
(since I forgot to change the folder names before the upload)

1. **HTML to TXT text converter** - This is an absolutely revolutionary bit of code that changes the text in a HTML file into plain text that is printed onto a .txt file.

    Nobel Prize winner right here I'll tell you h'what.

2. **Workout Uno** - This was the first project we worked on as a group. Its a variation of Uno where you are the only player and every card is either a workout or an action card that manipulates your workouts.

3. **Object Orientated Bang! - Card Game** - Currently under construction.
